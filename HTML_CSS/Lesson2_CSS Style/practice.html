    <h2>Linear Equations</h2>

    <p>
      A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <div><span> ax + b = 0 </span></div>
    <br /><br />
    <p>
      where <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> are real numbers and
      <strong>x</strong> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the
      standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will
      not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an
      <strong>x</strong> so don't get too locked into always seeing an x there.
    </p>

    <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>

    <p>
      The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
      <br /><br />
      <div><span> ax&sup2; + bx + c = 0</span></div>
      <br /><br />
      where <strong>a, b, c</strong> are known values and <strong>x</strong> is
      the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also,
      <strong>a</strong> can't be 0.
    </p>

    <h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>

    <p>
      <br />
      <strong>&pi;</strong> (Pi) times the radius (<strong>r</strong>) squared:
      <div>
        <br /><br />
    <span>
        A = &pi; &times; r&sup2; </span></div
      >
      <br /><br />

      or, when you know the diameter (<strong>D</strong> ):
      <div><br /><br /> <span>
        
        A = (&pi; / 4) &times; D&sup2; </span></div
      >
      <br />
      or, when you know the circumference (<strong>C</strong> ):
      <div>
        <br /><br />
        <span>A = C&sup2; / 4 &times; &pi;</span>
        </div
      >
    </p>

    <h2>Intersection</h2>
    <p>
      The intersection of two sets <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>,
      denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both
      the sets A and B. In symbols, <br />
      <br />
      <div><span> A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</span></div><br />
      <br />
      That is, <strong>x</strong> is an element of the intersection A &cap; B
      if and only if <strong>x</strong> is both an element of
      <strong>A</strong> and an element of <strong>B</strong> .
