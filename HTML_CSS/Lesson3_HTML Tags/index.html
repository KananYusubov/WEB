    <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>

    <h2>ACT 1</h2>

    <h2>PROLOGUE</h2>

    <p>
      Two households, both alike in dignity,
      <br />
      In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
      <br />
      From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
      <br />
      Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
      <br />
      From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
      <br />
      A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
      <br />
      Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
      <br />
      Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
      <br />
      The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
      <br />
      And the continuance of their parents' rage,
      <br />
      Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
      <br />
      Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
      <br />
      The which if you with patient ears attend,
      <br />
      What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
    </p>

    <h2>SAMPSON</h2>

    <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>

    <h2>GREGORY</h2>

    <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
